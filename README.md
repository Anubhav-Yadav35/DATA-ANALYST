## ðŸ§¼ Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**Dataset:** [Medical Appointment No Shows (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas  

### Objectives:
- Handle missing and duplicate data
- Standardize column names and text formats
- Convert string dates to datetime objects
- Remove invalid entries (e.g., negative ages)

**Deliverables:**
- `cleaned_medical_appointments.csv`
- Jupyter notebook with cleaning steps

---

## ðŸ“Š Task 2: Data Visualization & Storytelling

**Tools:** Tableau / Power BI  
**Dataset:** Cleaned output from Task 1  

### Visuals:
- Bar Chart: Show vs No-show count  
- Heatmap: Day vs Neighbourhood  
- Treemap: Neighbourhood-wise no-shows  
- Line Chart: Appointment trends  

**Insights:**
- Young patients (<25) had highest no-show rate  
- Certain neighbourhoods had significant no-show clusters  
- Females showed slightly higher no-show patterns  

**Deliverables:**
- Story_Report.pdf  
- Dashboard screenshots  
- README.md  

---

## ðŸ§  Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

**Tools:** SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL  
**Dataset:** Cleaned appointment data  

### SQL Concepts Applied:
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  
- Aggregate functions: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`  
- Joins and subqueries  
- View creation and indexing for performance

**Deliverables:**
- `data_analysis_queries.sql`  
- Output screenshots  
- README.md  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Task 4: Interactive Dashboard for Business Stakeholders

**Tool:** Tableau  
**Goal:** Build an interactive dashboard showing KPIs and trends in medical appointments.

### Features:
- KPI Cards: Total Appointments, No-show Rate, Average Age  
- Filters: Gender, Age Group, Day, Neighbourhood  
- Charts: Line, Bar, Treemap  

**Insights:**
- No-show rates vary by weekday  
- Young patients are less likely to attend  
- Strong correlation between region and no-shows  

**Deliverables:**
- `.twbx` Tableau dashboard file  
- PDF snapshots of dashboard  

---

## ðŸ§ª Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
**Dataset:** Titanic-Dataset.csv

### Analysis:
- Survival based on gender, age, class, and fare  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Age and fare distribution  
- Boxplots and scatterplots

**Insights:**
- Females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates  
- Younger passengers and those who paid higher fares fared better  

---

## ðŸ§¾ Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using SQL Aggregations

**Tools:** MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite  
**Dataset:** `online_sales`

### Objective:
Aggregate monthly revenue and order volume

**Deliverables:**
- SQL script for trend analysis  
- Result tables and visualizations  

---

## ðŸ“‰ Task 7: Basic Sales Summary Using Python & SQLite

**Tools:** Python, SQLite3, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Objective:** Perform SQL queries via Python and visualize results

### Process:
- Create SQLite DB & `sales` table  
- Insert sample data  
- Query total quantity & revenue  
- Generate bar chart for sales per product  

**Deliverables:**
- Python script  
- SQLite DB file  
- Chart: [Tiny SQLite Database using Python.pdf] (https://github.com/Anubhav-Yadav35/DATA-ANALYST/blob/main/Tiny%20SQLite%20Database%20using%20Python.png)

## ðŸ“Š Task 8: **Simple Sales Dashboard Design**

**Tools:** Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) / Power BI / Tableau  
**Dataset:** Sample - Superstore.csv  

### Objective:
Create a dashboard visualizing sales performance by:
- **Time (Month-Year)**
- **Region**
- **Product Category**

### Visuals:
1. Line Chart â€“ Sales Over Months  
2. Bar Chart â€“ Sales by Region  
3. Donut Chart â€“ Sales by Category  

### Key Insights:
